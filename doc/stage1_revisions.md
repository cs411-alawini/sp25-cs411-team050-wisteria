We added the cardinalities (row and columns numbers) for all of the data sets that we have currently included in Stage 1.
We made these changes because there was a comment on our initial submission mentioning that our TA took of -0.5 for not
including the cardinalities of the data sets. We added these changes in question 6 of Stage 1.
